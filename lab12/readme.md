# Tree Drawing - Lab 12

## Description
In this assignment, I learned how to set up a Python virtual environment and install third-party libraries. I used the `Tree` library along with the `Pillow` image library to generate recursive tree drawings. The goal was to explore how simple mathematical rules and recursion can create natural-looking shapes like trees.

I experimented with different parameters such as branch angles, scaling factors, trunk width, colors, and recursion depth (age) to see how they affect the appearance of the tree. Changing these values helped me understand how small adjustments can make the tree look more realistic or completely different.

I also practiced working with RGB colors to customize the background, leaves, and trunk colors of the tree.

## What I Did
- Created a virtual environment for the project.
- Installed the `Tree` and `Pillow` libraries.
- Ran and modified the provided tree-drawing code.
- Experimented with recursion depth (`age`) and branch configurations (`scales_and_angles`).
- Adjusted colors using RGB values to change the look of the tree.
- Observed how different settings can produce a variety of natural tree shapes.
